# Using Command Prompt
You dont HAVE to set up your environment variables before doing this, but its easiest if you set your Harmony Path to an environment variable. This way you can launch command prompt from any context and the Harmony processes will be available.

Some of the services that could be useful to use from command line are: ( the `-help` flag will display all available flags for that command )

* `harmonyPremium` Harmony launcher
* `utransform` rasterise image
* `pix2vec` vectorise image
* `setdef` Set render environments and machines
* `ControlCenter` Control Center
